## Key Insights

### Provincial Analysis
**Alberta**
- Robbery incidents ranging from 5,000-8,000 annually
- Top cities: Edmonton (127), Red Deer (119), Calgary (85)
- Forecasting models show cyclical patterns through 2024

**Manitoba**
- Robbery incidents ranging from 3,000-5,000 annually
- Top cities: Thompson (370), Winnipeg (271), Portage la Prairie (149)
- Highest per-capita crime rates among analyzed provinces

**Ontario**
- Robbery incidents ranging from 6,400-9,300 annually
- Top cities: Toronto (110), Hamilton (78), Peel Region (67)
- Largest absolute numbers but lower per-capita rates

### Statistical Findings
- Clear temporal patterns in robbery incident reporting
- Significant variations in crime rates between urban centers
- Provincial policy impacts visible in trend analysis
- Forecasting models indicate cyclical crime patterns
